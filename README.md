# MakeItFlow - Arduino Interaction

Modifications to FlowCloud's MakeItFlow android application, allowing more complex interactions with Arduino sketches running on the WiFire.

The original MakeItFlow can be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgtec.hobbyist) and the source can be found on the [FlowCloud developer website](http://flow.imgtec.com/developers/).

This modified app is a companion to the [FlowCloud on Arduino blog](http://flowcloud.github.io/flow-on-arduino/).

Modifications include showing returned data from the WiFire and (on the command parameters branch) allowing parameters to be passed along with commands to the WiFire.

## Using the modified app

The sources can be imported into Android Studio. The project uses gradle as a build system, so everything should run smoothly. 

Releases can also be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/FlowCloud/make-it-flow-arduino/releases).
